# Forge — Product Plan

## 1. Product Overview

### Product Name
Forge

### One-line Definition
Forge is a personal life intelligence system that turns daily behavior into insight, coaching, and deliberate self-improvement using data and AI.

### Core Idea
Forge helps you understand how your actions compound over time by capturing life signals as structured data, analyzing them across time and domains, and using AI to explain patterns and suggest adjustments.

Forge is built for long-term clarity, not short-term motivation.

## 2. What Forge Is / Is Not

### Forge IS
- A personal operating system for life analytics
- A private, single-user intelligence system
- A reasoning layer on top of personal data
- A tool for reflection, insight, and adjustment

### Forge IS NOT
- A motivational app
- A social platform
- A generic AI chatbot
- A habit streak game
- A replacement for therapy or medical advice

---

## 3. Product Philosophy (Non-Negotiable Principles)

### 3.1 Truth Over Convenience
- Raw data is immutable
- History is never rewritten
- Insights must be grounded in facts

### 3.2 Insight Before Advice
- No recommendations without data
- “Not enough data yet” is a valid state

### 3.3 AI Explains, Not Commands
- AI suggests and explains
- User retains agency
- No moralizing or shaming

### 3.4 Private by Default
- Built for one user first
- No unnecessary sharing
- Data ownership is central

### 3.5 Long-Term Orientation
- Optimize for months and years
- Avoid dopamine-driven engagement mechanics

---

## 4. Target User (v1)

### Primary User
The builder (you).

### User Characteristics
- Analytical and reflective
- Interested in strength training and self-improvement
- Comfortable with data
- Values depth over convenience

Forge is intentionally not mass-market in v1.
